# Logistic_Regression

## üìå Overview
This repository contains small projects demonstrating the use of *Logistic Regression* for classification problems:
1. *Predicting Insurance Purchase* ‚Äì Predicting whether a person will buy insurance with 100% accuracy on a small dataset.
2. *Predicting Employee Attrition* ‚Äì Determining whether an employee will leave the company using categorical data (dummy variables).

## üìñ About Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a *supervised classification algorithm* used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1).  
It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class using the *sigmoid function*:

\[
P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n)}}
\]

Where:
- \( P(Y=1) \) is the probability of the positive class  
- \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are input features  
- \( b_0, b_1, ..., b_n \) are coefficients  

The output probability is then converted into a class label based on a threshold (commonly 0.5).
